Apophis 2036 is the first full game built upon the Thermite3D game engine. It places the player in defense of the Earth as it is bombarded with fragments from the Apophis asteroid, in the year 2036.

The unique voxel technology used by the game allows the Earth to be modeled in a completely destructible fashion. Asteroids can strike from any direction and angle and the appropriate damage is applied to the Earth.

The player is able to defend the Earth by firing missiles at the incoming asteroid fragments. The aim is simply to keep as much of the Earth intact for as long as possible.
